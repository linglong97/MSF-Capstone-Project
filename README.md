## MSF Capstone Project

This is my repo to play around with the front-end of my Capstone design project. There needs to be a user friendly UI which people can use to view portfolios and play around with several financial models. This template is currently based on: http://startangular.com/product/ani-theme/. Core Technologies: NodeJS, React, Bootstrap.
